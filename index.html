    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a sophomore at UMD and am fascinated by compilers/programming languages. My hopes are to develop these interests over the coming years. I also love showing my artistic side by formatting my work and code whenever I can, especially by writing math assignments in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>.

      <p>
        &emsp; There is nothing more satisfying than letting my mind roam free. I love imagining new worlds, designing unique projects, traversing through problems, and burying myself in books. These habits have helped me excel as a student, and I'm confident when I say that my pursuit of knowledge, problem-solving, and creativity are the core to my success as a computer science and mathematics major.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; I built my pursuit of knowledge over these past two decades. As a child, I would read <i>Magic Tree House</i> in my free time, versus now where I willingly pick up a theoretical textbook such as <i>Types and Programming Languages</i> in between classes and assignments. My mind constantly craves new things, meaning I can satisfy it while propelling myself through my major. With so many disciplines and interested parties in computer science, it's difficult to stand out. But when I choose to challenge myself with esoteric readings (such as the textbook I mentioned above), I open up networks of thought that are otherwise overlooked in my major. When I started studying concepts in my new Programming Languages class this semester, I quickly connected completely new material to language theory concepts I had independently studied this summer. I have conditioned myself into a constant state of learning, and I believe it's one of my strongest qualities as a worker.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; With a constant flow of information came a unique ability to think abstractly. I was capable of solving problems in math class or  competitions. However, I also liked to reason about the proofs behind certain formulas. For example, rather than memorizing a method to solving a differential equation, I looked at the derivation for <i>why</i> that method worked. This did two things for me: it helped me solve problems quicker and overcome more difficult ones, but it also resonated with me to the point that I remembered how to do it years later. Even after not studying a topic for years, learning how to properly solve the problem rather than blindly memorizing made sure that I could recreate the solution in different applications or even years down the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; Although I have since detached from my early years of penciling, drawing, and painting, I still carry my creative and artistic side. Making my work look beautiful and presentable isn't just satisfying but also useful when I share it with professors or peers. When I made presentations for my communications class I would aim to make them eye candy, selecting colors and visuals that captivated my audience. If I were doing a math or computer science assignment, I wouldn't merely scan my messy handwritten scratch work, but rather I would format it in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> (or at least mimic the style) as I did for the page you're currently reading. Making my work neat is an instrumental skill even in computer science and later on for the workforce, and it's just as fulfilling for me to look back on old creations as it is for others to read them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; Ultimately, my desire for high-quality work and everlasting knowledge make me a solid candidate for computer science. I believe that being able to share the things I learn and the problems I can solve with the people around me (while doing so in a presentable manner) make me a team player and a capable worker. I never intend to stop learning, designing, and challenging myself, and I look forward to what the future has in stock for me.

      <h2 id="personal-statement">Work Samples</h2>
      <p>You can always visit the Github link at the top to see which projects I am currently updating. However, below I will share some of the projects that capture my work style. 
      </p>
      <h3>This Website</h3>
      <p>The page you're currently on is a perfect way to show off my attention to detail. I wanted to go beyond a portfolio on a job website, but to have my own personal domain to share my projects and my style. I aim for this webpage to be easy to follow, updated often, and visually appealing!</p>

      <h3>Matrix Reduction Paper</h3>
      <p>This was my first time writing a full paper on a singular math problem, and also the first time writing in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>. It was the perfect way to demonstrate my mathematical inclination, while also showing that I love well-formatted and high quality work. You can view the paper <a href="flops.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <h3>Cybersecurity Research</h3>
      <p>It was my first time doing a full research project, however I decided to take full responsibility to format the data well and present the paper professionally. My partner and I went in depth on the planning and sources to show that we're capable of leading a project and giving accurate results to answer interesting questions about attacker behavior. You can view the paper <a href="honeypot.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. 

      <h3>Sustainable Cities</h3>
      <p>Although this may seem largely unrelated to my major, I believe this project is one worth sharing. It was very important to me because it marked a point in time where I finally felt confident speaking in front of a crowd—something I struggled with a lot in my younger years—which I know is a vital asset for my career. I spoke deeply about a topic that is  important to me: motivating people to help clean up the planet and improve our quality of life. Finally, it was yet another way for me to demonstrate my artistic side, by making a beautiful presentation with a focus on typesetting and color theory. You can view the slideshow <a href="cities.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
